This project is an example of some of the things that I have learned or improved on at my time in Ironhack. Below are some languages and technologies I have used on this project.


The main goal of the project was to find a interesting data set and apply some key learning points from [Ironhack]. Some of these key points I have used, include the following:
 * Data Procurement
 * Data Wrangling
 * Data Cleaning
 * Data Manipulation
 * Inferential Analysis
 * Applied Supervised Machine Learning
 * Data Conversion/Exportation
 * And we can't forget the best part... Data Analysis
# Fun Facts!

  - This project was inspired by my classmates, whom all seem to be beer enthusiast at this point.
  - The reason I took this challenge was because almost everyone did data with a predictable outcome. 
  - - To explain a little more, I challenged myself to use data that was largely incomplete to show the skills I have learned.
  - More than half of the data was missing from the start.

# Tech

This project uses a number of open source libraries and tools to accomplish the goals:

* [Python] - The amazing Object Oriented Programming Language.
* [MYSQL] - The greatest Structured Query Language to exist. 
* [Pandas] - Used for loading, manipulating, and cleaning the data.
* [Numpy] - Used for converting the data into arrays the machine learning algorithm can use.
* [Seaborn] - Used for analysis of the data.
* [Matplotlib] - Used for analysis of the data.
* [Sqlalchemy] - Used to connect the Python IDE to a local MYSQL Database .
* [Scikit] - Used for the machine learning.
* [Tableau] - Used for presenting the data findings.
* [Jupyter Notebook] - The IDE used to run the code.



# Installation of the needed libraries

This project requires [Python] to run.

Install the dependencies and run the code in `main.ipynb`
!!!Please note, you will need [Jupyter Notebook] to run the script.!!!

```sh
$ pip3 install pandas
$ pip3 install numpy
$ pip3 install seaborn
$ pip3 install pandas
$ pip3 install matplotlib
$ pip3 install sklearn
$ pip3 install sqlalchemy
$ pip3 install pymysql
```

# What we have collected from the data
Here we can see the top five breweries and the major information about them. Some key points we can take from this data are:
1.) Ale seems to be the most produced for majority of this sample.
2.) The strongest drink seems to be .1% ABV.
3.) There are some companies that have more than one location.

Below is a comparison between the average ABV and IBU to styles of beer. Some key points from this data is:
1.) IPA seems to be the strongest, and most bitter on avarage.
2.) Stout seems to be a less bitter alternitive to IPA, with roughly the same strength.
3.) The most mild, least bitter, least strongest beer on avarage seems to be Pilsner.

Another interasting point that was found in the data was how the drink sizes vary based on style. Down below is what can be considerd from the data.
1.) IPA, and ALE both come in 5 diffrent sizes. This can idicate that in some markets, the beer can be small and strong, or large and bitter. (This adds much complexity to the data.)
2.) The special beers (Other) come in several diffrent sizes, indicating that it might be for a more specific target group.
3.) The less commonaly consumed drinks such as Porter or Cider come in much fewer sizes, indicating that there might be less of a market for the styles.

# The Data Team!

Everything that was done in this project was not without the help of everyone below. These people were here from start to finish, and have helped each other with everything this course has thrown at us. Special thanks to Himanshu, our wonderful teacher that has shown me the light on what it means to be a Data Analyst.
